            <!-- insert google doc notes in here: -->
            <p> Our topic is about personal organization of books and reading. Reading is an activity essential for education and personal growth, but managing and tracking progress can often be overwhelming. Readers can struggle tracking what books they read, or their thoughts and reflections they had while reading, making it less enjoyable.

                The information technology problem is that there is not a personalized platform where readers can track their progress and reflect all in one place. Some challenges a reader may face are:
                Not remembering what they previously read in the last chapter or book.
                Scattered tracking, such as book progress in another app and notes in another app.
                Features are not easy at glance. They are covered up menus and many clicks.
                Accessibility improvements such as light and dark mode when tracking their books on apps.

                Readers are lacking an interactive web application to manage their progress while keeping track of information about their books in a single space. When progress is scattered across multiple applications, the enjoyment from reading can contract. This can lead to missing opportunities to connect ideas between books and to reflect on personal growth overtime.

                One previous attempt to solve this problem is the known <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/">GoodReads</a> platform. GoodReads is well-known for reviews and book tracking, however since Amazon has bought GoodReads many years ago, the platform seem to maximize engagement and profit (Cerézo) rather than serving its best interest of readers. It’s outdated with many menus, no dark-mode for late nights (Norberg), small text, and personal notes are tied to pages which can be difficult to filter or access. In addition, many people complain about the lack of updates. GoodReads mainly focuses on the review aspect rather than journaling and reflection. A platform designed for book reflection and tracking can strengthen how people learn and connect with books they read.

            <h2> Proposed Application </h2>
            <!-- 2-3 paragraphs: insert google doc notes in here: -->
            <p>
                The primary users of our applications will be readers of all ages who want to organize the books they read or want to, track their reading progress, and reflect on their thoughts. Our users value learning, growth, and self-reflection through reading, but may currently find it difficult to manage their progress across multiple applications. The application will be designed with accessibility and inclusivity in mind, so it can serve a wide range of users. By offering features like larger text options, clear navigation, minimal visual clutter, and contrasting colors, the application will reduce usability barriers. For minority groups, our application will create a safe, private, and customizable reading space that encourages self-expression and personal reflection rather than social popularity, our platform avoids reinforcing biases that often appear on public review sites to promote equity in digital reading spaces and ensure readers can track and reflect on their books comfortably. Users will use our application to actively track, manage, and reflect on their reading progress, with several interactive features that allow users to engage with their own data rather than view fixed data.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Feature 1: Book Management and Notes</strong>
                <p>
                    Users can add, edit, and delete books from their personal library. Each book entry will have information about the title, author, genre, and reading status. Within each entry, users can write thoughts, notes, or highlight memorable quotes, allowing them to capture their personal thoughts while reading. They can also tag books with emotional or thematic tags, making it easier to revisit later on.
                </p>
            </li>
              <li><strong>Feature 2: Book and Goal Tracking</strong>
                <p>
                    Users can set reading goals. For example, “read two books this month” or “finish 20 books this year.” As users mark books as “finished” and complete their goals, a progress bar or tracker will automatically update to visualize their accomplishment.
                </p>
            </li>
              <li><strong>Feature 2.5: Filtering and Sorting</strong>
            <p>
                Users can filter and sort their book collection by attributes such as author, genre, reading status, date added, or emotional tags.
            </p>
        </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Users will primarily view information that they have entered themselves into the application. Our goal is to provide a private and focused reading tracker that does not rely on external data sources. All information will come directly from user input and be stored locally. This will ensure a private, customizable, and distraction-free experience and allow the user to be focused on their own habits and reflections rather than external reviews or social features. Our application addresses the issue of fragmented book tracking and reflection by combining organization, journaling, and goal tracking into one accessible platform. Instead of relying on multiple applications, users can log books, write reflections, and track progress all in one place. This unified system encourages readers to stay consistent, remember key ideas, and reflect deeply on what they read. It transforms reading from a scattered activity into an intentional practice that supports personal growth. From an informatics perspective, this application demonstrates how thoughtful, user-centered design can promote learning, mindfulness, and digital well-being rather than social engagement or profit.
