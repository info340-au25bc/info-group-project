            <!-- insert google doc notes in here: -->
            <p> Our topic is about personal organization of books and reading. Reading is an activity essential for education and personal growth, but managing and tracking progress can often be overwhelming. Readers can struggle tracking what books they read, or their thoughts and reflections they had while reading, making it less enjoyable.

                The information technology problem is that there is not a personalized platform where readers can track their progress and reflect all in one place. Some challenges a reader may face are:
                Not remembering what they previously read in the last chapter or book. 
                Scattered tracking, such as book progress in another app and notes in another app.
                Features are not easy at glance. They are covered up menus and many clicks.
                Accessibility improvements such as light and dark mode when tracking their books on apps.

                Readers are lacking an interactive web application to manage their progress while keeping track of information about their books in a single space. When progress is scattered across multiple applications, the enjoyment from reading can contract. This can lead to missing opportunities to connect ideas between books and to reflect on personal growth overtime.

                One previous attempt to solve this problem is the known <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/">GoodReads</a> platform. GoodReads is well-known for reviews and book tracking, however since Amazon has bought GoodReads many years ago, the platform seem to maximize engagement and profit (Cerézo) rather than serving its best interest of readers. It’s outdated with many menus, no dark-mode for late nights (Norberg), small text, and personal notes are tied to pages which can be difficult to filter or access. In addition, many people complain about the lack of updates. GoodReads mainly focuses on the review aspect rather than journaling and reflection. A platform designed for book reflection and tracking can strengthen how people learn and connect with books they read.
